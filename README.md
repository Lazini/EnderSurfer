EnderSurfer
===========

Description
Welcome to my first plugin! This plugin features live enderpearl teleportation. This means that, instead of throwing an enderpearl and waiting for it to hit the ground, it makes it as if you are the enderpearl and you travel just like it would travel.

Features
* Live enderpearl teleportation.
* Custom velocity.
* Custom heart loss when the shooter hits the ground.

Commands
* /setHearts: Sets the the number of half hearts that will be lost when someone hits the ground after throwing an enderpearl.
* /setVelocityMultiplier: Sets the velocity multiplier (enderpearl's velocity times the number you put here).


Credits
* To "aegisjester" for suggesting the plugin name.
* To "pogostick29" for his bukkit plugin development tutorials.
