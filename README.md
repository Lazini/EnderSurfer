=== Description ===
Welcome to my first plugin! This plugin features live enderpearl teleportation. This means that, instead of throwing an enderpearl and waiting for it to hit the ground, it makes it as if you are the enderpearl and you travel just like it would travel.

=== Features ===
* Enderpearl teleportation on-the-go.
* Custom velocity.
* Custom heart loss when the shooter hits the ground.
* Sneaking before throwing the enderpearl will make it be thrown in the usual way.

=== Commands ===
* **/setHearts**: Sets the the number of half hearts that will be lost when someone hits the ground after throwing an enderpearl. //Insert integers only//
* **/setVelocityMultiplier**: Sets the velocity multiplier (enderpearl's velocity times the number you put here). //Insert integers only//
* **/setDamageOnAir**: If set to true, the player will be damaged by the hearts specified in the **/setHearts** command. //Insert boolean values only//
